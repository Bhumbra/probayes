"""
Simple Metropolis Hastings sampler taken from Hogg and Foreman-MacKey(2018):

  From Problem 2:
  Sample in a single parameter x and give the sampler 
  as its density function p(x) a Gaussian density with 
  mean 2 and variance 2. Make the proposal distribution 
  q (x'∣x ) a Gaussian pdf for x′ with mean x and 
  variance 1. Initialize the sampler with x = 0 and run 
  the sampler for more than 10000 steps. Plot the results 
  as a histogram with the true density overplotted sensibly.
  
  Redo Problem 2, but now with an input density that
  is uniform on 3<x<7 and zero everywhere else. The plot
  should look like Figure 2. What change did you have to make
  to the initialization, and why?
